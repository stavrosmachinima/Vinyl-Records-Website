  <h2>Early history</h2>
  <p>
Brian May and Roger Taylor founded the band Smile in 1968, with Tim Staffell as the vocalist. He studied with Freddie Mercury at Ealing Art College, who was a big fan of the band. Therefore, when Tim Staffell left the group to join another, Humpy Bong, May and Taylor immediately thought of Mercury. Once the three of them were together, Smile’s name became Queen’s at the suggestion of Freddie himself. After playing songs of other bands and artists, they renewed some that they had composed for Smile and other previous bands.Freddie Mercury designed the logo of the band inspired by the zodiacal signs of its members: that is why you see two lions, by Deacon and Taylor who were Leo, a crab for May, who was Cancer, and two fairies for Mercury, who was Virgo.

<h2>
UK popularity & first single
</h2>
<p>
In 1974, Queen appeared in the Top of the Pops, where he played Seven Seas of Rhye. This presentation was broadcasted on television, which greatly promoted the theme. Quickly, EMI released a single with the song and with See What A Fool I’ve Been, with which they managed to be in the ranks of the 10 songs most listened for at least ten weeks. That same year, the second album of the band was released, Queen II, which was ranked No. 5 on the English list. Thanks to these two successes, Queen made its first tour, without being the opening show, in the United Kingdom.n 1975, the first single of its next album was published, Bohemian Rhapsody, with which they were during 18 months in the top of the list of the United Kingdom, and which granted Mercury the Ivor Novello Prize to him for the second occasion.
<h2>
  The 70's
</h2>
<p>
  After making a tour promoting their latest album, Queen released A Day at the Races in 1976, an album that is considered a sequel to the previous one, and News of the World in 1977, which is famous for its songs “We Will Rock You” and “We Are the Champions” which would be used in various sporting events. By 1978, Jazz would appear and in 1980 The Game. The following year, the band would make its first tour in South America.

<h2>The End</h2>
  <p>In 1987, Mercury’s couple, Jim Hutton, announced that the singer had AIDS, although all the members of the band denied it. However, in 1991 Mercury said in a statement that he did have the disease. In this same text, he asked for the support of his public and his friends to fight against the disease. Despite this, two days later, on November 24, Freddie Mercury died at only 45 years old.

After the death of the singer, an album with the greatest hits of the band was released, a commemorative concert was made and the album Made in Heaven and the song “No-One, but You” were published. The band entered the hall of fame in 2001 and the following year they got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2004, Brian May and Roger Taylor announced that they would join with Paul Rodgers to form Queen + Paul Rodgers. In 2008, the new group released the album The Cosmos Rocks, and finally separated in 2009.
